> **"Topology is not a hacking tool, but a microscope for vulnerability diagnostics. Ignoring it means building cryptography on sand."**

IsogenyGuard SDK is the world's first topological auditing framework for cryptographic key security. Based on groundbreaking research in algebraic topology applied to isogeny-based cryptosystems, it transforms theoretical insights into practical security tools that protect systems rather than exploit vulnerabilities.

## üî¨ Core Features

- **Topological Security Auditing**: Verify cryptographic implementations using Betti numbers (Œ≤‚ÇÄ=1, Œ≤‚ÇÅ=2, Œ≤‚ÇÇ=1)
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Identify weaknesses with F1-score up to 0.91 as validated in research
- **Private Key Protection**: Gradient-based analysis to detect potential key recovery vulnerabilities
- **AdaptiveTDA Compression**: Achieve 12.7x compression ratio while preserving 96% of topological information
- **Real-time Monitoring**: Track topological entropy (h_top) to ensure cryptographic strength
- **Protection, Not Exploitation**: All methods designed to strengthen security, not to exploit vulnerabilities

## üìä Theoretical Foundation

IsogenyGuard is built on the following key research results:

1. **Theorem 21**: The isogeny space for a fixed base curve is topologically equivalent to an (n-1)-dimensional torus
2. **Theorem 9**: Private key recovery through special point analysis
3. **Theorem 24**: Topological entropy h_top = log(Œ£|e_i|) as security metric
4. **Theorem 16**: AdaptiveTDA compression preserving sheaf cohomologies

Our research demonstrates that systems with anomalous Betti numbers or low topological entropy (h_top < log n - Œ¥) are vulnerable to attacks, while secure implementations maintain the expected topological structure.

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from PyPI (recommended)
pip install isogenyguard

# Or install from source
git clone https://github.com/miroaleksej/isogenyguard-sdk.git
cd isogenyguard-sdk
pip install -e .
```

### Basic Usage

```python
from isogenyguard import check_betti_numbers, recover_private_key

# Check cryptographic key security
j_invariants = [0.72, 0.68, 0.75, 0.65, 0.82]
result = check_betti_numbers(j_invariants)

print("Topological audit results:")
print(f"Betti numbers: Œ≤‚ÇÄ={result['betti_0']}, Œ≤‚ÇÅ={result['betti_1']}, Œ≤‚ÇÇ={result['betti_2']}")
print(f"Topological entropy: {result['topological_entropy']:.4f}")
print(f"Security status: {'SECURE' if result['is_secure'] else 'VULNERABLE!'}")

# Attempt private key recovery (for security testing)
ur_values = [5, 13, 21, 34, 42]
uz_values = [23, 52, 3, 35, 64]
r_values = [41, 41, 41, 41, 41]
n = 79

d = recover_private_key(ur_values, uz_values, r_values, n)
print(f"Recovered private key: d = {d}")
```

### Running the Example

```bash
# Install additional dependencies
pip install ripser scikit-learn

# Run the example
python examples/basic_usage.py
```

## üìà Security Verification Process

1. **Data Collection**: Gather ECDSA signatures for analysis
2. **Topological Analysis**: Compute persistent homology and Betti numbers
3. **Entropy Calculation**: Determine topological entropy h_top
4. **Security Assessment**:
   - Verify Betti numbers match theoretical values (Œ≤‚ÇÄ=1, Œ≤‚ÇÅ=2, Œ≤‚ÇÇ=1)
   - Ensure h_top > log n - Œ¥
   - Check for anomalous structures in persistent homology
5. **Protection**: Apply recommended security measures if vulnerabilities are found

## üí° Why Topological Security Analysis?

Traditional security analysis often focuses on cryptographic algorithms in isolation, ignoring the topological structure of the implementation space. Our research demonstrates that:

- Secure ECDSA implementations exhibit specific topological properties (Betti numbers Œ≤‚ÇÄ=1, Œ≤‚ÇÅ=2, Œ≤‚ÇÇ=1)
- Vulnerable implementations show anomalous topological structures
- Topological entropy h_top provides a quantitative security metric
- These properties are detectable *before* an actual attack can be mounted

By monitoring these topological characteristics, IsogenyGuard provides an early warning system for cryptographic vulnerabilities.

## üíº Real-world Integration

IsogenyGuard integrates seamlessly with existing security infrastructure:

```python
# Example: Integrating with a wallet security check
from isogenyguard import check_betti_numbers
from cryptosec import analyze_ecdsa_signatures

# Analyze wallet signatures
j_invariants = [0.72 * (sig["r"] / 79) for sig in wallet_signatures]
betti_result = check_betti_numbers(j_invariants)

# Get comprehensive security report
security_report = analyze_ecdsa_signatures(wallet_signatures)
```

This integration demonstrates how topological analysis (Theorem 21) translates to real security metrics with F1-score up to 0.91 as validated in Table 3 of the research.
