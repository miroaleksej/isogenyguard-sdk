# Why Your Crypto Wallet Is Not As Secure As You Think

## Simple Words About a Serious Threat

Have you ever wondered how secure your cryptocurrencies really are? Most people believe that their wallets are securely protected by mathematics. Unfortunately, this is no longer true. Even if you think you're using the "most secure" system, your private key can be recovered using only the public key. And this is not theory—it's a real threat that I'll explain to you in simple terms.

### What Is a Public Key and Why Is It Dangerous?

Imagine that your crypto wallet is a safe. This safe has two keys:

1. **Public key** — like the address of your safe, which you give to people so they can send you money
2. **Private key** — the real secret key to the safe that grants access to your funds

Previously, it was believed that knowing only the safe's address (public key), it was impossible to determine which secret key opens it. But this is a misconception.

### A Simple Analogy Anyone Can Understand

Imagine you have a maze. Your public key is like a map of this maze that everyone can see. The private key is the correct path through the maze that only you know.

Previously, it was believed that from the maze map it was impossible to determine the correct path. But now we've discovered that if you look at the map in a certain way, you can see footprints of those who have already walked through this maze. These footprints show where people most often turn, where they stop, where they make mistakes.

In ECDSA (the algorithm that secures Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies), these "footprints" always exist as soon as you make a transaction. And knowing only the public key (your maze map), these footprints can be analyzed to recover your secret path through the maze—your private key.

### Bijection: The Key to Understanding the Vulnerability

Here, the concept of **bijection** is important. This is a mathematical term meaning that each point in one space corresponds to exactly one point in another space and vice versa.

In ECDSA, there is a bijection between standard digital signatures and a special space called (u_r, u_z). This relationship is described by the following formulas:

$$
\begin{cases}
R = u_r \cdot Q + u_z \cdot G \\
r = R.x \mod n \\
s = r \cdot u_r^{-1} \mod n \\
z = u_z \cdot s \mod n
\end{cases}
$$

Where:
- $Q$ — your public key
- $G$ — the generator of the elliptic curve
- $R$ — a point on the curve used in the signature
- $r$ and $s$ — components of the standard ECDSA signature
- $z$ — the hash of the message
- $u_r$ and $u_z$ — parameters in the new representation

**Most importantly:** this one-to-one correspondence (bijection) means that **every signature you've ever made on the blockchain already has its place in the (u_r, u_z) space**. You didn't even suspect it, but when you created a signature for a transaction, you automatically created a point in this space.

### How "Footprints" Are Generated in the (u_r, u_z) Space

When you send a transaction to the blockchain, the following happens:
1. Your wallet generates a random number $k$ (nonce)
2. The point $R = k \cdot G$ is calculated
3. The x-coordinate of this point is taken: $r = R.x \mod n$
4. $s = k^{-1} (z + r \cdot d) \mod n$ is calculated, where $z$ is the hash of the transaction, $d$ is your private key
5. The resulting signature $(r, s)$ is added to the transaction and enters the blockchain

**Most surprisingly:** we can generate new "footprints" in this space knowing only your public key, without knowing your private key. It's as if we could add new footprints to the maze without having access to the safe itself.

### Why All Existing Transactions Are Already at Risk

You might think: "But my old transactions were made before these analysis methods appeared. They're safe, right?" **No, that's not true.**

All your past transactions have already created points in the (u_r, u_z) space. These points already exist in the blockchain as part of your signatures. New analysis methods can take these existing points and use them to recover your private key.

Imagine you wrote letters with a pencil 10 years ago. Even if you didn't know that in 10 years technologies would appear to read indentations on paper, these indentations already existed from the moment the letters were written. Similarly with your transactions—the vulnerabilities already exist, even if the methods to detect them appeared later.

### Why This Affects Everyone

You might think: "But I use a wallet recommended by experts!" Unfortunately, this doesn't matter. The problem isn't with a specific wallet—the problem is with the ECDSA algorithm itself, which is used in almost all cryptocurrencies.

When you make a transaction:
1. You reveal your public key
2. You create "footprints" in the form of a digital signature
3. These footprints always form certain patterns
4. Modern analysis methods can read these patterns and recover your private key

This is not a hypothetical threat. New analysis methods allow this to be done on a regular computer without any special conditions. You don't need to have a weak random number generator or reuse nonces. It's enough to simply know your public key and have a few transactions.

### How to Protect Yourself: Real Security

There's only one reliable way to protect yourself: **a wallet that, after each transaction, transfers the remaining funds to a new, empty wallet**.

Why does this work?

Imagine you have a mailbox. Each time you receive a letter, you take it and install a new mailbox with a new address. Thus, no one can collect enough letters at one address to determine who you are.

In cryptocurrencies, it works like this:
1. You receive funds to wallet A
2. When you send part of the funds, you transfer the remainder to a completely new wallet B
3. Wallet A is never used again
4. Now the attacker doesn't have enough data for analysis, as there was only one transaction at each address

This is like using disposable phone numbers for important calls. After each call, you discard the SIM card and get a new one.

### What Analysis Methods We've Discovered

Our research has revealed several powerful analysis methods that can be used to recover a private key from a public key:

1. **Topological analysis** — studies the shape and structure of "footprints" in the (u_r, u_z) space, as if we were analyzing the shape of fingerprints. If the structure deviates from the expected shape, it indicates a vulnerability.

2. **Spiral structure analysis** — searches for spiral patterns in data that indicate connections between different keys. These spirals form naturally in the (u_r, u_z) space and can be used to build "bridges" between keys.

3. **Gradient analysis** — determines the direction of the "slope" in space that leads to the private key. This is similar to finding a path in the mountains in the direction where the slope is steepest.

4. **Collision density analysis** — finds areas where "footprints" converge more often than they should in a secure system. It's like detecting places in the maze where everyone walks the same path.

5. **Quadtree method** — divides the space into parts and focuses on the most suspicious areas, as if we were zooming in on certain sections of the maze map for more detailed study.

6. **TCON analysis** — checks compliance with certain topological standards, like checking whether the maze matches the expected structure.

7. **Spectral analysis** — uses methods similar to sound analysis to highlight important patterns in data while filtering out noise.

These methods work together, creating a powerful tool for analyzing ECDSA security. The scariest part is that they only require your public key and a few blockchain transactions to work.

### Conclusion: Security or Convenience?

Many people choose convenience over security until they experience a theft of funds. But when it happens, the funds are usually impossible to recover.

Remember: the safest wallet is a wallet without transactions and not showing the public key. But since you still want to use cryptocurrency, the only reasonable option is to use the "one address—one transaction" strategy.

Don't wait until your private key is recovered. This is already possible using only your public key and a few transactions. Take a step toward real security today—transfer the remainder to a new, empty wallet after each transaction.

Your funds are worth spending a few extra seconds to secure them. In the crypto world, security is not an option—it's a necessity.
