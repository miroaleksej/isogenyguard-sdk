## Submission of Manuscript "Topological Structure of Digital Signatures: From ECDSA to Isogeny-Based Cryptosystems"

Dear Editors of Journal of Cryptology,

I am pleased to submit my manuscript titled "Topological Structure of Digital Signatures: From ECDSA to Isogeny-Based Cryptosystems" for consideration for publication in the Journal of Cryptology.

This work presents a novel topological model of digital signatures that fundamentally challenges the prevailing understanding of ECDSA security. Through rigorous mathematical analysis, I demonstrate that the space of all possible ECDSA signatures is topologically equivalent to a torus $\mathbb{T}^2$, with specific Betti numbers ($\beta_0=1$, $\beta_1=2$, $\beta_2=1$) serving as critical security indicators. The central finding—that all signatures exist "here and now" in a predetermined structure rather than being randomly generated—debunks the widespread misconception about ECDSA randomness that has persisted for decades.

The manuscript makes several significant contributions to cryptographic research:
1. Proof of topological equivalence between ECDSA signature space and a torus
2. Formulation and rigorous proof of the theorem on the existence of all signatures
3. Establishment of the connection between topological entropy $h_{top} = \log|d|$ and cryptographic security
4. Generalization of the topological model to isogeny-based cryptosystems
5. Development of practical verification methods through topological invariant analysis

This research emerged from my work at Tambov and represents a synthesis of algebraic topology and cryptographic analysis. The methodology has been experimentally validated across 10 popular ECDSA implementations, successfully identifying vulnerabilities through topological anomalies with 91% F1-score.

I believe this work aligns perfectly with the Journal of Cryptology's mission to publish high-quality research at the intersection of mathematics and cryptography. The topological approach presented here offers a fundamentally new perspective on cryptographic security analysis that extends beyond traditional methods.

I confirm that this manuscript is original, has not been published previously, and is not under consideration for publication elsewhere. All results presented are my own work, and appropriate credit has been given to the work of others through proper citations.

Thank you for considering my submission. I look forward to your evaluation and am available to provide any additional information or clarification as needed.

Sincerely,
