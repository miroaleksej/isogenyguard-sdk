![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a91a9030-b77e-4070-abf0-cc7c0507bb54)


## Overview

AuditCore v3.2 is a comprehensive framework for topological analysis of ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm) implementations. Unlike traditional cryptanalysis tools, it applies Topological Data Analysis (TDA) to detect structural vulnerabilities in ECDSA implementations by examining the topological properties of signature spaces.

This is a complete industrial implementation of the mathematical model described in "Logic, Structure, and Mathematical Model" documentation, combining advanced mathematical theory with production-grade engineering.

## Core Capabilities

### 1. Topological Analysis Engine
- Implements persistent homology using giotto-tda for Vietoris-Rips persistence
- Computes Betti numbers (β₀, β₁, β₂) to identify topological structures
- Detects torus structures (β₀=1, β₁=2, β₂=1) expected in secure ECDSA implementations
- Performs stability analysis through multi-scale Mapper algorithms

### 2. Vulnerability Detection System
- Identifies implementation weaknesses through topological anomalies
- Analyzes R_x tables for expected topological invariants
- Detects linear patterns (Theorem 9) indicating private key leakage
- Identifies spiral patterns revealing LCG vulnerabilities
- Flags periodic patterns indicating flawed random number generators

### 3. Advanced Analysis Components
- **BettiAnalyzer**: Quantifies topological features and stability metrics
- **CollisionEngine**: Finds repeated r values and analyzes their mathematical structure
- **GradientAnalysis**: Performs smoothing analysis for noise filtering
- **TCON (Topological CONformance)**: Verifies implementation against expected topological characteristics
- **HyperCoreTransformer**: Transforms signature data for optimal topological analysis
- **DynamicComputeRouter**: Manages computational resources for intensive topological calculations

### 4. Key Recovery Mechanisms
- Implements bijective parameterization (R = u_r · Q + u_z · G)
- Recovers potential private keys through linear dependencies
- Analyzes special points in signature space for vulnerability exploitation
- Provides confidence metrics for key recovery attempts

## Technical Implementation

AuditCore v3.2 is engineered as a production-ready system with:
- Industrial-grade error handling and monitoring
- GPU acceleration for persistent homology calculations
- Distributed computing support (Ray/Spark) for large-scale analysis
- Intelligent caching mechanisms for repeated computations
- Comprehensive CI/CD pipeline integration
- Real-time monitoring and alerting capabilities

The system follows a modular architecture where components work as an integrated pipeline, transforming raw signatures into deep security analysis with potential private key recovery when vulnerabilities exist.

## Ethical Usage Policy

This framework is designed **strictly for research and security auditing purposes**:

- ✅ **DO** use this tool to analyze systems you own or have explicit permission to test
- ✅ **DO** responsibly disclose any security findings to affected parties
- ✅ **DO** use findings to improve cryptographic security implementations
- ❌ **DO NOT** attempt to exploit vulnerabilities for personal gain
- ❌ **DO NOT** use this tool against systems without proper authorization
- ❌ **DO NOT** distribute recovered private keys or exploit information

The creators of AuditCore v3.2 do not endorse or support any unauthorized security testing or exploitation of cryptographic systems. The framework should only be used to strengthen ECDSA implementations, not compromise them.

## Limitations

1. **Research Tool**: This is an advanced research implementation, not a turnkey security solution
2. **Detection Boundaries**: May miss vulnerabilities or produce false positives depending on implementation specifics
3. **Mathematical Requirements**: Proper interpretation requires understanding of both elliptic curve cryptography and topological data analysis
4. **Resource Intensive**: Topological computations require significant computational resources for comprehensive analysis
5. **Implementation Specific**: Effectiveness varies based on specific ECDSA implementation characteristics
6. **Verification Required**: All potential vulnerabilities should be manually verified through alternative methods

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- NVIDIA GPU (recommended for acceleration)
- 16+ GB RAM (for large-scale analysis)

### Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/auditcore-v3.2.git
cd auditcore-v3.2

# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # Linux/MacOS
# venv\Scripts\activate  # Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install optional GPU acceleration
pip install "giotto-tda[gpu]"
```

## Basic Usage

```python
from auditcore import AuditCore
from auditcore.models import ECDSASignature

# Initialize the system
audit_core = AuditCore()

# Load signatures (example)
signatures = [
    ECDSASignature(r=0xabc, s=0xdef, message_hash=0x123),
    # ... more signatures
]

# Perform topological analysis
analysis_result = audit_core.analyze(signatures)

# Check security status
print(f"Vulnerability Score: {analysis_result.vulnerability_score:.4f}")
print(f"System Secure: {'Yes' if analysis_result.is_secure else 'No'}")

# View Betti numbers
print("Betti Numbers:")
for k, value in analysis_result.betti_numbers.items():
    print(f"  β_{k}: {value:.2f}")

# Generate security report
print(audit_core.generate_security_report(analysis_result))
```

## Advanced Features

### TCON Analysis (Topological CONformance)
```python
from auditcore.tcon import TCONAnalyzer

tcon = TCONAnalyzer()
result = tcon.analyze(rx_table)  # R_x table from signatures
print(f"Implementation secure: {result.is_secure}")
print(f"Vulnerability score: {result.vulnerability_score:.4f}")
```

### Collision Pattern Detection
```python
from auditcore.collision import CollisionEngine

engine = CollisionEngine()
collisions = engine.find_collisions(signatures)
pattern_analysis = engine.analyze_collision_patterns(collisions)

if pattern_analysis.linear_pattern_detected:
    print(f"Linear pattern detected (confidence: {pattern_analysis.linear_pattern_confidence:.2f})")
    print(f"Potential private key: {pattern_analysis.potential_private_key}")
```

### Multi-scale Mapper Analysis
```python
from auditcore.topological import TopologicalAnalyzer

analyzer = TopologicalAnalyzer()
mapper_result = analyzer.compute_multiscale_mapper(signatures)

# Visualize the Mapper graph
analyzer.visualize_mapper(mapper_result, "signature_mapper.png")
```
