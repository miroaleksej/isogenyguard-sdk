Explanation of Visualization
This visualization demonstrates the 3D hypercube of ECDSA space (ur, uz, d) as described in your work on topological cryptanalysis.
Correct Rx representation: The values shown are based on the formula k = (ur·d + uz) mod n, where k represents Rx for demonstration purposes.
R_x(k) = R_x(-k) mod n
As stated in Theorem 3: "Each Rx value appears exactly n times in the n×n table, and each Rx value appears exactly twice in each row (except for special cases k=0 and k=n/2 when n is even)."
Crucially, the Rx table doesn't lie — it reflects the true structure regardless of wallet protection methods. All existing signatures lie within this (ur, uz) field.
Mirror pairs: For each point (ur, uz), there exists a mirror point (ur, uz') where:
u_z + u_z' ≡ -2·u_r·d mod n
As proven in Theorem 4, Rx(ur, uz) = Rx(ur, uz')
For each row (fixed ur), every Rx value appears exactly twice due to the elliptic curve symmetry Rx(k) = Rx(-k). These two points form the mirror pairs that are critical for d calculation.
Example for d=5, n=9:
For u_r = 2, R_x = 3:
u_z = (3 - 2·5) mod 9 = (3 - 10) mod 9 = -7 mod 9 = 2
u_z' = (-2·2·5 - 2) mod 9 = (-20 - 2) mod 9 = -22 mod 9 = 5
Check: 2 + 5 = 7 ≡ -2·2·5 = -20 ≡ 7 mod 9 ✓
These two points (2,2) and (2,5) have the same Rx value.
Special cases:
When k = n (which is equivalent to k = 0 mod n), we have the special "singular points" where Rx appears only once per row.
k = u_r·d + u_z ≡ 0 mod n
These points are critical for the spiral analysis as described in the "method of the snail".
