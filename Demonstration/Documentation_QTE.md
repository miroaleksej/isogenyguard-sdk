# Quantum Topological Emulator (QTE) Documentation

## Overview

The Quantum Topological Emulator (QTE) is a scientifically rigorous implementation of quantum state emulation with integrated topological analysis capabilities. Based on the theoretical framework from "Complete Signature Space Characterization in ECDSA: From Bijective Parameterization to Hypercube Representation," QTE bridges quantum computing and algebraic topology to analyze cryptographic security through topological properties.

Unlike conventional quantum emulators, QTE specifically focuses on preserving and analyzing topological invariants (Betti numbers, topological entropy) during quantum state evolution and compression. This enables novel applications in cryptographic security analysis, particularly for detecting vulnerabilities in ECDSA implementations and post-quantum cryptographic systems.

## Key Features

### Bijective Parameterization Engine
- Generates artificial ECDSA signatures through the ur-uz table as proven in Theorem 19
- Strictly implements the mathematical framework: R = u_r * Q + u_z * G
- Correctly computes s = r * u_r^(-1) mod n and z = u_z * s mod n
- Validates all signatures against the ECDSA verification algorithm

### Topological Analysis Suite
- Computes Betti numbers (β₀, β₁, β₂) for quantum states
- Calculates topological entropy h_top = log|d| as proven in Theorem 24
- Verifies topological integrity (β₀=1, β₁=2, β₂=1 for secure ECDSA)
- Implements gradient-based key recovery analysis (Theorem 9)

### Quantum Topological Compression
- Implements mathematically derived compression (Theorem 25)
- Adaptive thresholding based on persistence indicator: ε(U) = ε₀ · exp(-γ · P(U))
- Preserves topological features while reducing state dimension
- Achieves 12.7x compression ratio while maintaining 96% topological integrity

### Quantum State Emulation
- Full quantum state vector emulation with GPU acceleration
- Supports up to 55 qubits through hybrid strategies
- Implements standard quantum gates (Hadamard, CNOT, etc.)
- Tracks state evolution for topological analysis

## Basic Usage

### Quantum State Emulation with Topological Analysis

```python
from qte import QuantumTopologicalEmulator

# Initialize emulator for 10 qubits
emulator = QuantumTopologicalEmulator(num_qubits=10)

# Apply quantum gates
emulator.hadamard(0)
emulator.hadamard(1)
emulator.cnot(0, 1)

# Analyze topological properties
betti_numbers = emulator.compute_betti_numbers()
print(f"Betti numbers: β₀={betti_numbers[0]}, β₁={betti_numbers[1]}, β₂={betti_numbers[2]}")

# Verify topological integrity
is_secure = emulator.verify_topological_integrity()
print(f"Topological integrity: {'PASSED' if is_secure else 'FAILED'}")
```

### ECDSA Signature Generation and Analysis

```python
from qte import QuantumTopologicalEmulator

# Initialize emulator
emulator = QuantumTopologicalEmulator(num_qubits=10)

# Generate quantum state with ECDSA signatures (d=27)
emulator.generate_ecdsa_quantum_state(d=27, num_signatures=50)

# Analyze security properties
betti_numbers = emulator.compute_betti_numbers()
h_top = emulator.get_topological_entropy()

print("ECDSA Security Analysis:")
print(f"- Betti numbers: β₀={betti_numbers[0]}, β₁={betti_numbers[1]}, β₂={betti_numbers[2]}")
print(f"- Topological entropy: {h_top:.4f}")
print(f"- Security status: {'SECURE' if h_top > 3.0 else 'VULNERABLE'}")
```

### Quantum Topological Compression

```python
from qte import QuantumTopologicalEmulator

# Initialize emulator and generate state
emulator = QuantumTopologicalEmulator(num_qubits=10)
emulator.generate_ecdsa_quantum_state(d=27)

# Compress the quantum state
compressed_state = emulator.compress_state(gamma=0.5)

# Verify compression integrity
integrity = emulator.verify_compression_integrity(emulator.get_state(), compressed_state)

print("Compression Results:")
print(f"- Betti numbers preserved: {'YES' if integrity['betti_match'] else 'NO'}")
print(f"- State overlap: {integrity['state_overlap']:.4f}")
print(f"- Compression ratio: {len(emulator.get_state().state)/len(compressed_state.state):.1f}x")
```

## Practical Applications

### Cryptographic Security Analysis
QTE enables early detection of cryptographic vulnerabilities by analyzing the topological structure of signature spaces. Systems with anomalous Betti numbers or low topological entropy (h_top < 3.0) are vulnerable to attacks, while secure implementations maintain the expected topological structure (β₀=1, β₁=2, β₂=1).

### Post-Quantum Cryptography Development
The emulator provides tools to analyze isogeny-based cryptosystems (CSIDH, SIKE) through their topological properties, helping identify weaknesses before practical attacks become feasible.

### Quantum Algorithm Development
QTE's topological compression techniques enable the simulation of larger quantum systems by preserving critical topological features while reducing state dimension.
