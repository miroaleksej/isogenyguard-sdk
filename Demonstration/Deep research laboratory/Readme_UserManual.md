The **Deep Research Laboratory (DRL)** is a comprehensive, research-grade software system designed to apply advanced topological and geometric analysis to complex systems across multiple scientific domains. It is not a collection of isolated tools, but a **unified scientific framework** built on the principle that deep structural analysis can reveal hidden vulnerabilities, predict new phenomena, and guide optimization.

DRL integrates the following modules into a single, cohesive platform:
- **Cryptography (ECDSA, SIKE, CSIDH)**
- **Quantum Physics (Atomic Structure)**
- **Particle Physics (Standard Model)**
- **Biology (Aging and Rejuvenation)**
- **Earth Observation (Satellite Anomaly Detection)**
- **Quantum Topological Emulation (QTE)**

## 🔬 Core Principles

DRL is built on the following key research results:

- **Theorem 1**: The mapping $(r,s,z) \leftrightarrow (u_r,u_z)$ is bijective, enabling a complete parameterization of the ECDSA signature space.
- **Theorem 9**: The private key $d$ can be recovered from special points in the $R_x(u_r, u_z)$ table via $d \equiv -(\Delta u_z) \mod n$.
- **Theorem 21**: The isogeny space for a fixed base curve is topologically equivalent to an $(n-1)$-dimensional torus.
- **Theorem 24**: Topological entropy $h_{\text{top}} = \log(\Sigma|e_i|)$ serves as a fundamental security metric.
- **Theorem 16**: AdaptiveTDA compression preserves sheaf cohomologies, allowing for efficient, structure-preserving data reduction.

Our research demonstrates that systems with **anomalous Betti numbers** or **low topological entropy** ($h_{\text{top}} < \log n - \delta$) are vulnerable to attacks, while secure implementations maintain the expected topological structure.

        - `qte`: For simulating topological anomalies and testing compression algorithms.

2.  **Load Input Data:**
    - Click the "Browse" button to select a data file relevant to your chosen domain.
    - Supported formats:
        - **`crypto`**: JSON file with a list of ECDSA signatures (`{"signatures": [{"r": 41, "s": 43, "z": 4}, ...], "n": 79}`).
        - **`quantum`**: JSON file with atomic configuration (`{"element": "Hydrogen", "atomic_number": 1, "resolution": 64}`).
        - **`earth`**: HDF5 file with satellite data, or a CSV file of coordinates.
        - Other modules can be initialized with default parameters if no file is provided.

3.  **Run the Analysis:**
    - Click the "Load & Initialize" button.
    - The system will:
        - Load your data.
        - Build the corresponding multidimensional hypercube.
        - Perform a full topological analysis.
        - Display the results in the visualization pane.

4.  **Interpret the Results:**
    - The GUI will display a visualization of the analysis (e.g., a 3D plot of a quantum hypercube, a map of Earth anomalies, or a bar chart of energy levels).
    - Key metrics (Betti numbers, topological entropy, recovered private keys, etc.) are shown in the status bar and can be found in the console output.

### Run Example Usage (Command Line)

To see the system in action without the GUI, run the example script:

```bash
python examples/example_usage.py
```

This script will demonstrate all six modules in sequence, showing how to perform analyses in each domain.

## 📚 User Manual

### **1. Cryptography Module (`crypto`)**

**Purpose:** To audit ECDSA and isogeny-based (SIKE/CSIDH) cryptographic systems for vulnerabilities.

**Key Theorems Applied:**
- **Theorem 9**: Recovers the private key $d$ from special points in the $R_x(u_r, u_z)$ table.
- **Theorem 24**: Uses topological entropy $h_{\text{top}} = \log(\Sigma|e_i|)$ as a security metric. A system is considered vulnerable if $h_{\text{top}} < \log n - \delta$.
- **Theorem 21**: Verifies the expected topological structure (an $(n-1)$-torus) by checking Betti numbers ($\beta_0=1, \beta_1=n-1, \beta_k=\binom{n-1}{k}$).

**Usage:**
- **Input Data**: A JSON file containing a list of ECDSA signatures with the same $R_x$ value. This indicates a potential nonce bias.
